# ðŸ§­ React Router (Custom)

This is a simple client-side routing library built with React (without any external libraries).

It includes:

- A `<BrowserRouter>` that tracks the current URL
- A `<Route>` component that shows content based on the path
- A custom `<Link>` that updates the URL without reloading the page

The goal was to better understand how routing works in single-page apps â€” like how to change the URL using the History API, and how to show different components depending on the current path.

This project helped me start connecting what I had learned about `useState`, `useEffect`, and `useContext` in a more real way.

Built with [Vite](https://vitejs.dev/) for fast development and a lightweight setup.
